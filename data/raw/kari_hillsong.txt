Song: King Of Majesty


You know that,  
I love you,  
You know that,  
I want to know you so much more,  
More than I have before  
  
These words are,  
From my heart,  
These words are,  
Not made up,  
I will live for you,  
I am devoted to you,  
  
King of Majesty  
I have one desire  
Just to be with you my Lord,  
Just to be with you my Lord,  
  
Jesus you are the Saviour of my soul  
And forever and ever I'll give my praises to you,  
Jesus you are the Saviour of my soul  
And forever and ever I'll give my praises to you,  
  
Jesus you are the Saviour of my soul  
And forever and ever I'll give my praises to you

You gave me hope you made me whole at the cross.  
You took my place you showed me grace.

Song: Centre Of My Life


Let my walk speak loud  
And my words be true  
Let my life be whole  
With my eyes on you  
Lord I'm stepping out  
From the comfort zone  
Letting go of me,  
Holding onto You  
  
Freedom comes  
When I call You Lord  
You are Lord my God  
  
You are the centre of it all,  
The universe declares in awe  
Your majesty  
I surrender all  
I make you  
The centre of my life  
Lord, I respond with all I am  
You placed in me the song  
Of heavens melody  
Your Majesty  
I live to sing Your song  
  
I have found Your peace  
It replaces any fear  
You have done it all  
I can trust in you  
So I'm stepping out  
From the comfort zone  
Letting go of me  
Holding onto you  
  
This is your song not mine  
It is your song that bring healing to this land  
This is your song not mine  
It is your song that brings feedom  
Freedom comes, when I call you Lord  
Freedom comes, when I call you Lord  
You are Lord, my God  
You are the song  
You are the majesty  
I live to sing your song  
Your majesty  
I live to sing Your song

Song: Here Now (Madness)


Skies spin their dance within Your breath  
Time runs its race within Your hand  
And my mind runs wild to comprehend  
What no mind on earth could understand  
  
Your ways are higher  
Your thoughts are wilder  
Love came like madness  
Poured out in blood-washed romance  
It makes no sense but this is grace  
And I know You're with me in this place  
  
[Refrain]  
Here now  
All I know is I know that You are here now  
Still my heart  
Let Your voice be all I hear now  
Spirit breathe like the wind  
Come have Your way  
Cause I know You're in this place  
  
Faith makes a fool of what makes sense  
But grace found my heart when logic ends  
When justice called for all my debts  
The Friend of sinners came instead  
  
Your ways are higher  
Your thoughts are wilder  
Love came like madness  
Poured out in blood-washed romance  
It makes no sense but this is grace  
And I know You're with me in this place  
  
[Refrain 2]  
Here now  
All I know is I know that You are here now  
Still my heart  
Let Your voice be all I hear now  
Spirit breathe like the wind  
Come have Your way  
  
Cause I know that You are here now  
Heart and soul  
God I know that You are here now  
Fix my eyes on the things that I can't see now  
And all I see is the glory of Your name  
  
Cause I know that You are here now  
Still my heart  
Let Your voice be all I hear now  
Fix my eyes on the things that I can't see now  
Spirit breathe like the wind  
Come have Your way  
  
Cause I know that You are here now  
Still my heart  
Let Your voice be all I hear now  
Fix my eyes on the things that I can't see now  
Spirit breathe like the wind  
Come have Your way  
Cause I know that You are here now  
Still my heart  
Let Your voice be all I hear now  
Fix my eyes on the things that I can't see now  
Spirit breathe like the wind  
Come have Your way

Song: Church On Fire


The Holy Spirit is here and His power is real  
Anything can happen and it probably will  
Something very good something good is going on around here  
  
There's a light that shines to make the dark disappear  
A power at work but there's nothing to fear  
Something very good something good is going on around here  
  
This is a church on fire  
This is the Holy Spirit flame  
We have a burning desire  
To lift up Jesus' name  
Let the fire burn in every heart  
To light the way, defeat the dark  
Let the flame of love burn higher  
This is a church  
This is a church on fire

Song: Did You Feel The Mountains Tremble?


Did you feel the mountains tremble?  
Did you hear the oceans roar?  
When the people rose to sing of  
Jesus Christ, the risen one  
  
Did you feel the people tremble?  
Did you hear the singers roar?  
When the lost began to sing of  
Jesus Christ, the saving one  
  
And we can see that God, You're moving  
A mighty river through the nations  
And young and old will turn to Jesus  
Fling wide Your heavenly gates  
Prepare the way of the risen Lord  
  
Open up the doors and let the music play  
Let the streets resound with singing  
Songs that bring Your hope  
Songs that bring Your joy  
Dancers who dance upon injustice  
  
Did you feel the darkness tremble  
When all the saints join in one song  
And all the streams flow as one river  
To wash away our brokeness  
  
And here we see that God, You're moving  
A time of Jubilee is coming  
When young and old return to Jesus  
Fling wide your Heavenly gates  
Prepare the way of the risen Lord

Song: Love Enough


Your love's enough to see the broken hearts  
Gain a brand new start with a brand new heart  
As the faithful hope in things unseen  
You're enough to see all the things they dream  
Come to life  
  
Were living in the Saviour today  
And this day is what we have now  
In this moment we have chosen to praise  
And it's changing how we live now  
  
Your love it broke my fall  
It's more than enough and I need it  
Cause I've never known better  
And I'll never know better  
  
This love will see me soar  
It's more than enough and I need it  
Cause I've never known better  
And I'll never know better  
  
Your love's enough to see the humbled man  
Find the cause of Christ  
With his outstretched hands  
As the cripple grabs his mat to walk  
You're enough to save him from the pain he bore  
  
My Saviour  
You'll never let me go  
My life is now secure  
  
My Saviour  
You'll never let me go  
And in Your hands my future's brighter

I need Your Love  
Like the desert needs the rain  
I need Your touch  
Like the fire needs the flame  
One moment without You near  
Is heartache I cannot bear  
A lifetime with You O Lord  
Is Heaven I long to Know

Come over me  
Like the oceans meets the shore  
Shine on my life  
Like the morning  
Steals the night  
One moment without you near  
Is heartache I cannot bear  
A lifetime with you oh Lord  
Heaven I long to know

For the love poured out  
For the price of freedom  
Let the whole Earth sing  
Hear the praises rising

Song: Desert Song


This is my prayer in the desert  
And all that's within me feels dry  
This is my prayer in the hunger in me  
My God is a God who provides  
  
And this is my prayer in the fire  
In weakness or trial or pain  
There is a faith proved  
Of more worth than gold  
So refine me Lord through the flames  
  
[Chorus]  
And I will bring praise  
I will bring praise  
No weapon forged against me shall remain  
  
I will rejoice  
I will declare  
God is my victory and He is here  
  
And this is my prayer in the battle  
And triumph is still on it's way  
I am a conqueror and co-heir with Christ  
So firm on His promise I'll stand  
  
All of my life  
In every season  
You are still God  
I have a reason to sing  
I have a reason to worship  
  
This is my prayer in the harvest  
When favor and providence flow  
I know I'm filled to be emptied again  
The seed I've received I will sow

Beauty for ashes  
Life evermore  
Peace beyond measure  
Jesus won it all  
  
Saved out of darkness  
Cleansed by His blood  
Into His Kingdom

Water of life  
Let all who thirst, come  
Worship Jesus Christ

Song: We Are


Every secret, every shame  
Every fear, every pain  
Live inside the dark  
But that's not who we are  
We are children of the day.  
  
So wake up sleeper  
Lift your head  
We were meant for more than this  
Fight the shadows, conquer death  
Make the most of time we have left.  
  
We are the light of the world  
We are the city on the hill  
We are the light of the world  
We gotta, we gotta  
We gotta let the light shine.  
  
Let the light shine  
Let the light shine.  
  
We are called to spread the news  
Tell the world the simple truth  
Jesus came to save  
There's freedom in his name  
So let it all breakthrough.  
  
We are the light, we are the light  
We are the light  
To let your light shine brighter.  
  
We are the light, we are the light  
We are the light, Jesus.  
  
We are the light, we are the light  
We are the light  
We will lift you high and  
Shine, shine, shine.  
  
We gotta shine, we gotta shine  
Let the light shine  
Let the light shine.

Song: Arise


Explorers and soldiers  
  
Searching and fighting  
To learn, to realize  
  
Straight through our soul  
With invisible thread  
The pieces undone  
Are whole now instead  
  
The fight we're in  
Has already been won  
  
Arise  
For the kingdom has come  
Arise  
For the kingdom has come  
  
Your story was made of  
Beauty and soul  
We're closer to heaven  
Than we'll ever know  
  
Woven in time  
  
To breathe and create  
A sacred thing  
  
The fight we're in  
Has already been won  
  
Arise  
For the kingdom has come  
Arise  
For the kingdom has come

No mind can know what God has in store  
So open up Heaven, open it wide  
Over Your church and over our lives

I'm so amazed at how You take my life  
And love me more, more than I deserve  
I'm blown away by Your power to change this life  
Once more, I'm planted in You

I will live to honour You my Lord  
You are the gold, treasure of all life  
I will rest in You in praise eternally  
  
Who would know that I was once  
On a road so far away from You  
All I know is that I live my life

Song: Believe


I say on Sunday how much I want revival  
But then on Monday, I can't even find my Bible  
Where's the power  
The power of the cross in my life  
  
I'm sick of playing the game of religion  
I'm tired of losing my reason for living  
Where's the power  
The power of the cross in my life  
  
I'm not content just to walk through my life, giving in  
To the lies, Walking in compromises now  
We cry out as a generation that was lost  
But now is found in the power of the cross  
  
Chorus:  
We believe in You  
We believe in the power of Your Word that is true  
We believe in You  
So we lay down our cause  
That our cross might be found in You  
  
I'm not satisfied doing it my own way  
I'm not satisfied to do church and walk away  
I'm not satisfied there's no love in my life but You  
I'm not satisfied living in yesterday's hour  
I'm not satisfied to have the form but not the power  
I'm not satisfied, Lord I am crucified in You  
[Chorus:]  
  
So we lay down our cause  
That our cross might be found in You

Song: Forever And A Day


Gloriously You saved me  
You saved me  
So miraculously  
You made me brand new  
You welcomed me with open arms  
Open arms  
Unfailingly  
Your love is a river  
  
So I will praise You  
I will praise You  
  
I'll praise Your name  
Forever and a day  
And I'll live for You into eternity  
I'll praise Your name  
Forever and a day  
And I'll live what I sing  
What I say  
What I'm learning everyday  
  
Generously You gave me  
You gave me  
Marvelously You made me  
You made me  
Relentlessly I follow  
I follow  
Your majesty, breathtaking  
So beautiful

Song: Angels


Angels  
Words and Music by Marty Sampson  
  
The holiest place there could ever be  
All you can do is bow  
Before the one who made heaven and earth  
Before the Almighty God  
For Him alone  
  
Sing with the angels  
Sing with the angels  
Singing the name of the lord  
Singing the name of the lord  
  
For every soul  
He gave it all  
Given for all of mankind  
Eternal life is His alone  
Given to all who believe  
In Him alone  
  
Jesus...  
Jesus...  
Jesus...

Song: I Could Sing Of Your Love Forever


[Intro:]  
Over the mountains and the sea  
Your river runs with love for me  
And I will open up my heart  
And let the Healer set me free  
I'm happy to be in the truth  
And I will daily lift my hands  
For I will always sing of  
Of when Your love came down  
  
[Chorus:]  
I could sing of Your love forever (x4)  
  
[Bridge:]  
Oh I feel like dancing  
It's foolishness I know  
But when the world has seen the light  
They will dance with joy  
Like we're dancing now  
  
I could sing of your love forever (5x)

Something very good something good is going on around here

Let the fire burn in every heart to light the way, defeat the dark

Lord, I lift my voice in praise to You  
For the love You placed inside of me  
Lord, I give my life, my heart and soul

To you my love, my joy, my song  
I lift my voice, my heart and soul  
In worship  
  
As eagles soar across the sky  
So my spirit reaches high  
Toward you  
  
As the deer pants for the water so  
My soul cries for you  
As a child has rest in arms of love  
So I rest in you  
  
You are the great and mighty  
Risen lord my king of glory  
Oh my soul bless the lord  
  
You reign in strength and power  
Awesome god my strong tower  
Oh my soul bless the lord

Song: Heart Of Worship


When the music fades  
All is stripped away  
And I simply come  
Longing just to bring  
Something that's of worth  
That will bless your heart  
  
I'll bring you more than a song  
For a song in itself  
Is not what you have required  
You search much deeper within  
Through the way things appear  
You're looking into my heart  
  
Chorus  
I'm coming back to the heart of worship  
And it's all about you  
It's all about you, Jesus  
I'm sorry Lord for the things I've made it  
When it's all about you  
It's all about you, Jesus  
  
King of endless worth  
No one could express  
How much you deserve  
Though I'm weak and poor  
All I have is yours  
Every single breath  
  
Chorus

You lead me by the waters still  
You lay me down to rest upon your faithfulness  
My Shepherd, simply take my hand  
Your song restores my soul  
For Your name, You make me whole  
Joyfully I lift my voice in praise to Thee  
With heaven watching over me I raise my hands up high  
Your Majesty gently washes over me  
Makes my heart begin to sing joyfully  
No shadow ever shall I fear  
Your peace, my heart will know  
My cup it overflows  
Your goodness chases after me  
Your mercy and Your grace will be my dwelling place  
Joyfully I lift my voice in praise to Thee  
With heaven watching over me I raise my hands up high  
Your Majesty gently washes over me  
Makes my heart begin to sing joyfully  
I will sing from the mountain top  
I will sing, I am overcome, I will sing making melodies  
I will sing from the valley low  
I will sing because of Your love I will sing  
You're my King, I will sing  
Joyfully I lift my voice in praise to Thee  
With heaven watching over me I raise my hands up high  
Your Majesty gently washes over me  
Makes my heart begin to sing joyfully  
Joyfully, joyfully, joyfully

And all my fears, so far away  
And all I feel is Heaven calling me  
  
So I look to You  
So I look to You  
No one else will do  
No one else will do  
  
So I look to You  
So I look to You  
No one else will do  
No one else will do  
  
So I look to You  
So I look to You  
No one else will do  
No one else will do  
  
So I look to You  
So I look to You  
No one else will do  
No one else will do  
  
So I look to You  
So I look to You  
No one else will do  
No one else will do  
  
So I look to You  
So I look to You  
No one else will do

Song: Find You On My Knees


Trouble chasing me again  
Breaking down my best defense  
I'm looking  
God I'm looking for your  
  
Weary just won't let me rest  
And fear is filling up my head  
I'm longing  
God I'm longing for you  
But I will  
  
Find you in the place I'm in  
Find you when I'm at my end  
Find you when there's  
Nothing left of me to offer you  
Except for brokenness  
  
You lift me up  
You never leave me thirsty  
When I am weak  
When I'm lost and searching  
I find you on my knees  
  
So what if sorrow shakes my faith  
What if heartache still remains  
I'll trust you  
My god I'll trust you  
'Cause you are faithful  
And I will  
  
When my hope is gone  
When the fear is strong  
When the pain is real  
When the it's hard to heal.  
  
When my faith is shaken  
And my heart is broken  
And my joy is stolen  
God I know that you lift me up  
You never leave me searching

Song: Can't Stop Talking


Chorus:  
Can't stop talking 'bout everything He's done  
It's the best thing, happened since the world began  
It didn't come cheap but I got it for free  
It's the hope of glory, Christ in me  
  
He helped me to see when my spirit was blind  
It's amazing if you look just what you'll find  
Every step I took, He took two  
If He did it for me, He can do it for you  
  
Do you know Him? (Yes, I do)  
Do you know what I say is true?  
Do you know Him? (Yes, I do)  
If He did it for me, He can do it for you

The Lord's my Shepherd, I have everything I need.  
Mercy and love follow me.  
Though I walk through the dark valley of death, I will  
Not be afraid for He's here.  
  
The Lord's my refuge, no evil can come near me,  
Dwelling in His secret place.  
I put my trust in Him, He is my shield, I will  
Let His peace rule in my heart.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Surely, the Angel of the Lord is around me.  
I have no cause to fear, my God will not forsake me.  
I am His child, no enemy can touch me.  
I will not die but live, to tell what He has done.  
  
He has ransomed me, He gave me all authority,  
Power, love and a sound mind.  
Strong in the Lord and the power of His might, I will  
Put on His armour and stand.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Surely, the Angel of the Lord is around me.  
I have no cause to fear, my God will not forsake me.

Song: More Than Anything


You knew us from the start  
Our every moment  
Though we fell apart  
You chose to love us  
Never letting go  
You sent Your Son for us  
  
He came into the world  
With one desire  
To lead us from our sin  
Remove our failures  
So we could meet with You  
And know ourselves as Yours  
  
In a world that tries to  
Find a way in itself  
Searching high and low  
Looking for a meaning  
We will hold to what we  
Know is truth know is love  
Life is found when we give  
Ourselves all to You Lord  
  
Give it all give it all to the One who's Life  
Give it all give it all to the One who's Life  
Give it all give it all to the One who's Life  
Saved mine  
  
Our future in Your hands  
Our lives with purpose  
Sins now erased our past behind us  
Never looking back  
We know ourselves as Yours  
  
This we know we have a new life  
We are Yours now and forever  
In this life all that we seek  
To be with You more than anything

Song: What Love Is This


You never change, you are the God you say you are  
When I'm afraid you calm and still my beating heart  
You stay the same, when hope is just a distant thought  
You take my pain and you lead me to the cross  
  
What love is this, that you gave your life for me  
And made a way for me to know you  
And I confess you're always enough for me you're all I need  
  
I look to you, I see the scars upon your hands  
And hold the truth that when I can't you always can  
I'm standing here beneath the shadow of the cross,  
I'm overwhelmed that I keep finding open arms  
  
What love is this that you gave your life for me  
And made a way for me to know you  
And I confess, you're always enough for me you're all I need  
  
Jesus in your suffering you were reaching your thought of me  
Jesus in your suffering you were reaching your thought of me  
  
What love is this, that you gave your life for me  
And made a way for me to know you  
And I confess, you're always enough for me  
You're all I need  
  
What love is this, that you gave your life for me  
And made a way for me to know you  
And I confess, you're always enough for me  
Always enough for me

The savior alone carried the cross  
For all of my debt, He paid the cost  
Salvation complete  
Now forever I'm free

My sin and shame don't count anymore  
All praise to the One who has ransomed my soul

Can separate us from mercy and grace  
He is faithful to save  
Oh, His blood never fails

Calvary covers it all  
My sin and shame don't count anymore  
All praise to the One who has ransomed my soul

Can make us pure as snow  
We stand in Your freedom

We've got nothing to lose  
We've got no reason to hide  
We've got the answer inside of us  
It's time we took the disguises off  
Well see Your glory revealed  
And see Your Name lifted high  
There is nobody else for us  
Jesus You are the only One  
  
You're alive and we are free  
You are everything  
Everything we need

Not a second to lose  
There's a city that waits for us  
It's time we took all the lamp shades off  
Well see Your glory revealed  
And see Your Name lifted high  
There is nobody else for us  
Jesus You are the only One  
  
Love has spoken and we believe  
You are everything  
Everything we need

Nothing could ever separate us now

Nothing compares to You  
Nothing could ever separate us  
From this love

Beautiful God  
Laying Your majesty aside  
You reached out in love to show me life  
Lifted from darkness into light  
Oh

Trading Your righteousness for shame  
Despite all my pride and foolish ways  
Caught in Your infinite embrace

Caught up in grace like an avalanche  
Nothing compares to this love love love  
Burning in my heart

Breathing Your life into my heart  
Your word is the lamp unto my path  
Forever I'm humbled by Your love  
Oh  
  
Take my life  
Take all that I am  
With all that I am I will love You

God rest ye merry gentlemen  
Let nothing you dismay  
Remember Christ our Savior

To save us all from Satan's power  
When we were gone astray  
  
Oh tidings of comfort and joy  
Comfort and joy

From God our heav'nly Father  
A blessed angel came  
And unto certain shepherds  
Brought tidings of the same  
How that in Bethlehem was born  
The son of God by name  
  
Now, to the Lord sing praises  
All ye within this place  
And with true love and brotherhood  
Each other now embrace  
This holy tide of Christmas  
All others doth deface

Verse 1:  
Upon the hill on Calvary  
He came from Heaven's throne  
Our fallenness and mercy meet  
Where blood and water flow

What grace divine what selflessness  
That Christ would bear the weight  
Our proof is scarred on hands that bled  
That we were worth every nail

And all the praise and glory to God  
We sing Hallelujah sing Hallelujah  
For the King has carried the cross  
He is risen from the grave

Beyond the tomb to holy skies  
He rose in victory  
And bridged for us the great divide  
His life is our liberty  
  
Chorus x2

Your love  
It's Your love  
It's Your love

That has claimed me

Song: Heaven And Earth


Love that was foretold  
When the prophets spoke  
Of one to come  
  
Heaven came for us  
Reconciling hearts  
To You our God  
  
Heaven and earth collide  
The Savior for everyone has come  
Bringing the dead to life  
All for the glory of Your name  
  
Now He comes with hope  
In salvation's robe  
To lead us home  
  
Healing in His wings  
Freedom in His scars  
His kingdom come  
  
Heaven and earth collide  
The Savior for everyone has come  
Bringing the dead to life  
All for the glory of Your name  
  
By His stripes we are healed  
By His death we can live  
In Jesus name, in Jesus name  
All oppression will cease  
Every captive released  
In Jesus name, in Jesus name  
  
By His stripes we are healed  
By His death we can live  
In Jesus name, in Jesus name  
All oppression will cease  
Every captive released  
In Jesus name, in Jesus name  
  
Heaven and earth collide  
The Savior for everyone has come  
Bringing the dead to life  
All for the glory of Your name  
  
By His stripes we are healed  
By His death we can live  
In Jesus name, in Jesus name  
All oppression will cease  
Every captive released  
In Jesus name, in Jesus name  
  
By His stripes we are healed  
By His death we can live  
In Jesus name, in Jesus name  
All oppression will cease  
Every captive released

Song: Found


Amazing love  
Now what else shall I need  
Your name brings life  
Its more than the air I breath  
  
My world was changed  
When your life you gave for me  
My purpose found  
And all that you want for me  
  
And Ive found myself in you  
And Ive found myself in you  
  
Take me to a place  
Where I can see you face to face  
And all I want to do  
All I want to do  
Is worship you

Song: Broken Vessels


All these pieces  
Broken and scattered  
In mercy gathered  
Mended and whole  
Empty handed  
But not forsaken  
I've been set free  
I've been set free  
  
Amazing grace  
How sweet the sound  
That saved a wretch like me  
I once was lost  
But now I'm found  
Was blind but now I see  
  
Oh I can see it now  
Oh I can see the love in Your eyes  
Laying yourself down  
Raising up the broken to life  
  
You take our failure  
You take our weakness  
You set Your treasure  
In jars of clay  
So take this heart, Lord  
I'll be Your vessel  
The world to see  
Your love in me  
  
Amazing grace  
How sweet the sound  
That saved a wretch like me  
I once was lost  
But now I'm found  
Was blind but now I see  
  
Oh I can see it now  
Oh I can see the love in Your eyes  
Laying yourself down  
Raising up the broken to life  
  
Amazing grace  
How sweet the sound  
That saved a wretch like me  
I once was lost  
But now I'm found  
Was blind but now I see  
  
Amazing grace  
How sweet the sound  
That saved a wretch like me  
I once was lost  
But now I'm found  
Was blind but now I see  
  
Oh I can see it now  
Oh I can see the love in Your eyes  
Laying yourself down  
Raising up the broken to life  
  
Amazing grace  
How sweet the sound  
That saved a wretch like me  
I once was lost  
But now I'm found  
Was blind but now I see  
  
Amazing grace  
How sweet the sound  
That saved a wretch like me  
I once was lost  
But now I'm found  
Was blind but now I see  
  
Oh I can see it now  
Oh I can see the love in Your eyes  
Laying yourself down  
Raising up the broken to life  
  
Oh I can see it now  
Oh I can see the love in Your eyes  
Laying yourself down  
Raising up the broken to life  
  
Oh I can see it now  
Oh I can see the love in Your eyes  
Laying yourself down  
Raising up the broken to life

Song: All The Power You Need


My God can never fail  
He's beem proved time and again  
Trust Him you'll see  
He's got all the power you need  
  
He's never early never late  
It takes courage and it takes faith  
Trust Him you'll see he's got  
All the power you need  
  
He saves forgives and heals  
He takes back what the devil steals  
My debt's paid in full  
And every day He does miracles  
  
God dreams turn them into plans  
Too big for human hands  
Trust Him you'll see  
He's got all the power you need  
  
He's real He's real  
Faith's a lot stronger than what you feel  
He's real He's real  
I'm believing for miracles  
  
Trust Him you'll see  
He's got all the power you need

Light of men, love of God  
Healing for the wounded heart  
Like a child I quiet my soul  
Hear Your voice surround me, Lord

And Lord, my soul delights and I know You hear my prayer  
Take me deeper, oh, Lord

Bow my knee, bow my will  
Cherished by the strong and the weak  
Humble hearts shall hear You speak

And Lord, my soul delights and I know You hear my prayer  
Take me deeper

Song: Love Is War


In Your justice and Your mercy  
Heaven walked the broken road  
Here to fight this sinner's battle  
Here to make my fall Your own  
  
Turn my eyes to see Your face  
As all my fears surrender  
Hold my heart within this grace  
Where burden turns to wonder  
  
I will fight to follow  
I will fight for love  
Throw my life forever  
To the triumph of the Son  
  
Let Your love be my companion  
In the war against my pride  
Long to break all vain obsession  
Till You're all that I desire  
  
Turn my eyes to see Your face  
As all my fears surrender  
Hold my heart within this grace  
Where burden turns to wonder  
  
I will fight to follow  
I will fight for love  
Throw my life forever  
To the triumph of the Son  
  
And I know Your love has won it all  
You took the fall  
To embrace my sorrows  
I know You took the fight  
You came and died but the grave was borrowed  
I know You stood again  
So I can stand with a life to follow  
In the light of Your name  
  
Turn my eyes to see Your face  
As all my fears surrender  
Hold my heart within this grace  
Where burden turns to wonder  
  
I will fight to follow  
I will fight for love  
Throw my life forever  
To the triumph of the Son  
  
And I know Your love has won it all  
You took the fall  
To embrace my sorrows  
I know You took the fight  
You came and died but the grave was borrowed  
I know You stood again  
So I can stand with a life to follow  
In the light of Your name  
  
And I know Your love has won it all  
You took the fall  
To embrace my sorrows  
I know You took the fight  
You came and died but the grave was borrowed  
I know You stood again  
So I can stand with a life to follow  
In the light of Your name

Song: My Home


Into Your courts I run  
With praises flowing from my heart  
Everyday I wake  
I sing Your song  
It's the anthem of my life  
  
I want to spend my days  
In Your presence, Lord  
Bowed before Your throne  
In the house of God  
Is where I find my peace  
It's where I find my  
Home is Heaven  
One day Lord I will live  
In Your courts You'll find me  
In worship at Your feet  
Hide me now  
In the shadow of Your wings  
Where I will be  
Where I will be  
  
Your love is all I need  
So desperately I have sought Your face  
I know You hear my every cry  
And petition that I make  
  
Jesus  
Oh, You are my treasure

Here before Your alter  
I am letting go of all I've held  
Of every motive, every burden  
Everything that's of myself  
  
And I just wanna wait on You, my God  
I just wanna dwell on who You are  
  
Beautiful, beautiful  
Oh, I am lost for more to say  
Beautiful, beautiful  
Oh Lord You're beautiful to me  
  
Here in Your presence  
I am not afraid of brokenness  
To wash Your feet with humble tears  
I would be poured out till nothing's left  
  
And I just wanna wait on You, my God  
I just wanna dwell on who You are  
  
Beautiful, beautiful  
Oh, I am lost for more to say  
Beautiful, beautiful  
Oh Lord You're beautiful to me  
  
Beautiful  
You're beautiful, oh You're beautiful  
Beautiful, beautiful

Fall back on everything You've done  
Fall back on everlasting arms  
When all the world is swept away  
You are all the things I need  
You're the air I breathe

You were the one on the cross  
Lifted for all our shame?  
How can it be  
The scars in Your hands are for me?  
You are the king of all

Verse  
On the mountain  
In the valley  
Everywhere I go  
You are with me  
Right beside me  
You never let me go  
The Messiah  
The Almighty  
Saviour of my soul  
Saviour of my soul  
  
In the daylight  
In the shadow  
Your faithfulness untold  
You surround me  
And protect me  
Guiding as I go  
The Messiah  
The Almighty  
Saviour of my soul  
Saviour of my soul  
  
Pre-Chorus  
There is nowhere I can run  
There is nowhere I can hide  
And if I ever lose my way  
You're calling out my name  
You're calling out my name

And only You can save us Jesus  
Only You can heal us Jesus  
Only You can fix this Jesus  
Only You Jesus

The broken have been chosen  
The city is becoming alive in You

Holy Spirit, Touch Your people  
Teach us the ways of God  
And as we live, As Jesus did  
You are honored and lifted up  
There's a stirring in the Spirit  
There's an urgency in this hour  
We as children must obey  
Can you hear  
The footsteps of God  
God is moving, God is moving  
Can you hear the sound  
Of revival  
As we praise You, as we sing  
Draw near to us O God  
As we cry out for the nations  
Pour out revival in the land  
There's a stirring in the Spirit  
There's an urgency in this hour  
We as children must obey  
Can you hear  
The footsteps of God

Bring an offering, Come before You  
Worship You Lord

Cherished beyond all words

Song: Here I Am To Worship


Light of the world  
You stepped down into darkness  
Opened my eyes let me see  
Beauty that made this heart adore You  
Hope of a life spent with You  
  
Here I am to worship  
Here I am to bow down  
Here I am to say that You're my God  
You're altogether lovely  
Altogether worthy  
Altogether wonderful to me  
  
King of all days  
Oh so highly exalted  
Glorious in heaven above  
Humbly You came to the earth You created  
All for love's sake became poor  
  
I'll never know how much it cost  
To see my sin upon that cross  
  
Tag:  
Call upon the name of the Lord

Song: Oh You Bring


Oh you bring hope to the hopeless  
And light to those in the darkness  
And death to life, now I'm alive  
  
Oh you give peace to the restless  
And joy to homes that are broken  
I see you now, in you I'm found  
  
And you open the door for me  
And you lay down your life to set me free  
All that I am will serve you lord  
  
Oh you fill those who are empty  
And rescue those in the valley  
And through it all you calm my soul  
  
Oh now you find me in my weakness  
And heal the wounds of my heartache  
And worship for you in spirit and truth  
  
And you open the door for me  
And you lay down your life to set me free  
All that I am will serve you lord  
  
And you open my eyes to see  
All the wondering all of christ in me  
Jesus you're everything I need

All honor  
All glory  
All praise to you (repeat)  
  
And you open the door for me  
And you lay down your life to set me free  
All that I am will serve you lord  
  
And you open my eyes to see  
All the wondering all of christ in me  
Jesus you're everything I need

Though all of the earth  
Will fade away  
His truth will remain

You are worthy of all praise

Did You rise the sun for me?  
Or paint a million stars that I might  
Know your majesty?  
Is Your voice upon the wind?  
Is everything I've known marked?  
With my maker's fingerprints?  
  
Breathe on me  
Let me see Your face  
Ever I will seek You

'Cause all You are, is all I want, always  
Draw me close in Your arms  
Oh God, I want to be with You  
  
Can I feel You in the rain?  
Abandon all I am to have You  
Capture me again  
Let the earth resound with praise  
Can You hear as all creation lives  
To glorify one name?

I begin to dream of the future  
What's next to be

Saved my soul  
Made me new  
Now I live for You

In the Saviour  
Gave His life for me  
By Your Word  
We will be the light of the world

Be a light in the world  
When Your praises are heard

Song: Forever


The moon and stars they wept  
The morning sun was dead  
The Savior of the world was fallen  
His body on the cross  
His blood poured out for us  
The weight of every curse upon him  
  
One final breath He gave  
As Heaven looked away  
The Son of God was laid in darkness  
A battle in the grave  
The war on death was waged  
The power of hell forever broken  
  
The ground began to shake  
The stone was rolled away  
His perfect love could not be overcome  
Now death where is your sting  
Our resurrected King has rendered you defeated  
  
Forever, He is glorified  
Forever, He is lifted high  
Forever, He is risen  
He is alive  
He is alive  
  
The ground began to shake  
The stone was rolled away  
His perfect love could not be overcome  
Now death where is your sting  
Our resurrected King has rendered you defeated  
  
Forever, He is glorified  
Forever, He is lifted high  
Forever, He is risen  
He is alive  
He is alive  
Forever, forever  
  
You have overcome  
Your resurrected King  
You have overcome the grave  
You have overcome  
  
We sing Hallelujah  
We sing Hallelujah  
We sing Hallelujah  
The Lamb has overcome  
  
We sing Hallelujah  
We sing Hallelujah  
We sing Hallelujah  
The Lamb has overcome  
  
We sing Hallelujah  
We sing Hallelujah  
We sing Hallelujah  
The Lamb has overcome  
  
We sing Hallelujah  
We sing Hallelujah  
We sing Hallelujah  
The Lamb has overcome  
  
We sing Hallelujah  
We sing Hallelujah  
We sing Hallelujah  
The Lamb has overcome  
  
We sing Hallelujah  
We sing Hallelujah  
We sing Hallelujah  
The Lamb has overcome  
  
Forever, He is glorified  
Forever, He is lifted high  
Forever, He is risen  
He is alive  
He is alive (Forever)  
  
Forever, He is glorified  
Forever, He is lifted high  
Forever, He is risen  
He is alive

Song: Beautiful Exchange


You were near, Though I was distant  
Disillusioned I was lost and insecure  
  
Still mercy fought, For my attention  
You were waiting at the door, Then I let You in  
  
Trading Your life, For my offenses  
For my redemption, You carried all the blame  
  
Breaking the curse, Of our condition  
Perfection took our place  
  
When only love  
Could make a way  
You gave Your life  
In a beautiful exchange  
  
My burden erase, my life forgiven  
There is nothing, that could take this love away  
  
My only desire, and sole ambition  
Is to love You just the same  
  
When only love  
Could make a way  
You gave Your life  
In a beautiful exchange  
  
When only love  
Could break these chains  
You gave Your life  
In a beautiful exchange  
  
Holy are You God  
Holy is Your name  
With everything I've got  
My heart will sing how I love You

And Your hand, it comforts me  
From the ends of the Earth to the depth of my heart

As angels understand  
For Your glory, may You draw all men  
As Your love and grace demand  
  
And I will run to You  
To Your words of truth  
Not by might, not by power  
But by the spirit of God  
Yes I will run the race  
'Till I see Your face  
Oh let me live in the glory of Your grace

Song: Beneath The Waters (I Will Rise)


This is my revelation  
Christ Jesus crucified  
Salvation through repentance  
At the cross on which He died  
  
Now hear my absolution  
Forgiveness for my sin  
And I sink beneath the waters  
That Christ was buried in  
  
[Chorus:]  
I will rise, I will rise  
As Christ was raised to life  
Now in Him, now in Him  
I live  
  
I stand a new creation  
Baptized in blood and fire  
No fear of condemnation  
By faith I'm justified  
  
[Chorus:]  
I will rise, I will rise  
As Christ was raised to life  
Now in Him, now in Him  
I live  
[X2]  
  
I rise as You are risen  
Declare Your rule and reign  
My life confess Your Lordship  
And glorify Your Name  
Your Word it stands eternal  
Your Kingdom knows no end  
Your praise goes on forever  
An on and on again  
  
No power can stand against You  
No curse assault Your throne  
No one can steal Your glory  
For it is Yours alone  
I stand to sing Your praises  
I stand to testify  
For I was dead in my sin  
  
[Chorus:]  
But now I rise, I will rise  
As Christ was raised to life  
Now in Him, now in Him  
I live  
  
I will rise, I will rise  
As Christ was raised to life  
Now in Him, now in Him  
I live

Song: Jesus The Same


There's a light in the darkness that shines  
Giving hope to all the world  
Hope to all the world  
There's a door that's been opened to all  
Into a new and living way  
A new and living way  
  
Praise the name of Jesus  
Perfect Redeemer  
Star of the morning  
Yesterday, today and forever  
Jesus the same  
Jesus the same  
  
There's a fire that burns in our hearts  
To see the lost return to the Father  
It's a passion that's not of our own  
We have seen it in the Son  
In the face of the Son  
  
Wonderful Counselor  
Mighty God  
Eternal Father  
Prince of Peace

Song: I Live For You


The day I found You,  
You made my world brand new,  
And You covered it with love  
  
Changed my direction,  
And now I'm heaven bound  
I'm running to You  
  
Once lost, but now I'm found in You  
Once shipwrecked now I'm grateful these days  
I live for You  
  
Like a river, You flood my soul with love  
Overflowing into joy  
Like a downpour, Your spirit raining down  
Let it fall, Let it fall  
  
I'm living for the King  
  
I live for You

Song: Did You Hear The Mountains Tremble?


Did you feel the mountains tremble?  
Did you hear the oceans roar?  
When the people rose to sing of  
Jesus Christ the risen one  
  
Did you feel the people tremble?  
Did you hear the singers roar?  
When the lost began to sing of  
Jesus Christ the saving one  
  
And we can see that God you're moving  
A mighty river through the nations  
When young and old return to Jesus  
Fling wide your heavenly gates  
Prepare the way of the risen Lord  
  
Open up the doors and let the music play  
Let the streets resound with singing  
Songs that bring your hope  
Songs that bring your joy  
Dancers who dance upon injustice  
  
Did you feel the darkness tremble  
When all the saints join in one song  
And all the streams flow as one river  
To wash away our brokenness  
  
And we can see that God you're moving  
A time of Jubilee is coming  
When young and old will turn to Jesus  
Fling wide your heavenly gates  
Prepare the way of the risen Lord  
  
[Chorus:]

Song: Lord Over All


In the valley of the unknown  
I will lift my voice  
In the shifting, in the shadow  
I know You are with me  
  
Lord over all  
You will be my rescue  
You will never fail  
Lord, through it all  
I will choose to trust You  
You will never fail  
  
In the searching and the waiting  
You quiet my soul  
In the stillness of Your presence  
I know You are with me  
  
Out of this darkness  
Into Your promise  
You will deliver me  
Eternal Savior  
You stand forever  
You are my victory

All for love a Father gave.. For only love could make a way... All for love

ask..  
And how many times have you heard me pray..Draw near to me..  
  
Everything I need is You  
My beginning and forever  
Everything I need is You  
  
Let me sing all for love.. I will join the angel song. Ever Holy is the Lord,
King of Glory, King of All.  
  
All for love a Saviour prayer.. Abba Father have your way.. Though they know
not what they do.. Let the cross draw man to you

Covered by Your love  
You're my deepest dream I know  
Your love so strong, spirit come  
You lift me up to heaven's door

Every beat of my heart, breath that I take  
Through the seasons that change, Your love remains  
My hiding place, my home falling in love

This is the hour, the time has come  
His Spirit calls, He calls us on  
To make this land, holy for the Lord  
  
This is the time to seize the day  
We rise in faith, the promise comes  
To make this land, holy to the Lord  
  
These are the days of the latter rain  
Days of power, days of grace  
This is the time the fire will fall  
To make this land holy  
To make this land holy to the Lord  
  
This is the time, our finest hour  
Of battles fought and victories won  
To make this land holy to the Lord  
  
And from this time our future calls  
The promise sure, the rain will fall  
We see this land holy to the Lord

Standing tall in this wide space  
Getting lost in Your embrace  
I see a fire burning brighter  
It's calling me to catch the flame

And that my soul knows very well

And that my soul knows very well

And in Your heart of hearts I'll dwell

And that my soul knows very well  
Forgiveness, hope, I know is mine  
And that my soul knows very well

Song: Devotion


I've been running, trying to be one who sees  
I've been working, salvation out on my knees  
There is nothing better than knowing  
That we are redeemed  
Unbelieving, trusting in creative hands  
I am praying for our world to bow to your plan  
And this one thought is unmistakable  
I take up my cross and follow you Lord  
  
[Chorus:]  
When you stand the tall trees and mountains bow  
When you speak the fiercest of oceans is still  
And I see the sinner seek devotion  
The lost become chosen, and I fall to my knees  
  
Unforgiven, my savior who did not deserve death  
He was blameless and I was lost in shamefulness  
Undelivered, but it doesn't seem right  
Unless I keep my eyes focused on the savior who gave his live  
In the middle of a world that denies it believes  
It is breaking apart at the very seams  
There is one thing to be alive for  
And it's to take up my cross and follow you Lord  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And I fall to my knees  
  
I will take up my cross and follow Lord where you lead me  
And I will take up my cross and follow wherever you go  
I will take up my cross and follow Lord where you lead me  
And I will take up my cross and follow wherever you go  
  
[Chorus x2]  
  
And I fall to my knees  
I fall to my knees  
I fall to my knees

And watch as Your glory unfolds  
For there is no measure or end  
To the power You hold  
  
Justice and truth are Your virtues  
With many too vast for our words  
No mind contains the splendour  
Of all that You are  
  
Our God  
Our God has done great things  
Our God is greater than all  
  
Miracles are Your memorial  
The promise of wonders to come  
You are the Author  
God You complete it all  
  
All of the praise  
Unto Your Name  
Be lifted higher  
  
All of the praise  
Unto Your Name  
Forever

Song: Man Of Sorrows


Verse  
Man of sorrows Lamb of God  
By His own betrayed  
The sin of man and wrath of God  
Has been on Jesus laid  
  
Silent as He stood accused  
Beaten mocked and scorned  
Bowing to the Father's will  
He took a crown of thorns  
  
Chorus  
Oh that rugged cross  
My salvation  
Where Your love poured out over me  
Now my soul cries out  
Hallelujah  
Praise and honour unto Thee  
  
Verse  
Sent of heaven God's own Son  
To purchase and redeem  
And reconcile the very ones  
Who nailed Him to that tree  
  
Bridge  
Now my debt is paid  
It is paid in full  
By the precious blood  
That my Jesus spilled  
  
Now the curse of sin  
Has no hold on me  
Whom the Son sets free  
Oh is free indeed  
  
Verse  
See the stone is rolled away  
Behold the empty tomb  
Hallelujah God be praised  
He's risen from the grave

Speak peace into my soul  
Take me as I am  
Awaken my heart to beat again  
  
Oh Jesus  
Oh Jesus  
Oh Jesus  
Alive in me  
  
You move in the unseen  
You set the captives free  
As I stand and sing  
You're breaking the chains off me  
  
Breathe in me Your life  
I can feel You are close now  
I can never hide  
You are here and You know me  
All I need is You  
And I love You  
I love You  
I love You  
I love You  
  
Breathe in me Your life  
'Til Your love overtakes me  
Open up my eyes  
Let me see You more clearly  
Falling on my knees  
'Til I love like You love  
Like You love me  
I love You

Song: Children Of The Light


[Verse:]  
Children in the wilderness  
Following the love You poured out for us  
Covered by the Name that we confess  
Jesus Saviour forever  
  
Roaming through the dark of night  
Clinging to the word that burns deep inside  
Eyes fixed on Your Name and endless light  
Jesus Saviour forever

Set alight to follow  
In the shadow of Your Name  
The world is Yours and I know  
Everything will find it's place  
Under Your Name  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Walking on through the fire  
Knowing I will not be burned but refined  
Fearless in Your Name ever by my side  
Jesus Saviour forever  
  
Taking on the raging storm  
Anchored to the kingdom unshakable  
Holding to Your Name that outshines all  
Jesus Saviour forever  
  
[Chorus:]  
Set alight to follow  
In the shadow of Your Name  
The world is Yours and I know  
Everything will find it's place  
Under Your Name

Children of the light  
Blazing through the night  
Taking back what the devil had stolen  
  
Calling on Your Name  
Breaking every chain  
Jesus everlasting freedom  
  
Running through the wild  
Dancing in the fire  
Taking back what the devil had stolen  
  
Calling on Your Name  
Breaking every chain  
Jesus everlasting freedom

Set alight to follow  
In the shadow of Your Name  
The world is Yours and I know  
Everything will find it's place

The world is Yours and I know  
Everything will find it's place  
Under Your Name  
Jesus under Your Name

Song: None but Jesus


In the quiet, in the stillness  
I know that You are God  
In the secret of Your presence  
I know there I am restored  
When You call I won't refuse  
Each new day again I?ll choose  
There is no one else for me  
None but Jesus  
Crucified to set me free  
Now I live to bring Him praise  
In the chaos, in confusion  
I know you're sovereign still  
In the moment of my weakness  
You give me grace to do Your will  
So when You call I won't delay  
This my song through all my days  
There is no one else for me  
None but Jesus  
Crucified to set me free  
Now I live to bring Him praise  
All my delight is in You, Lord  
All of my hope, all of my strength  
All my delight is in You, Lord, forevermore

Oh Lord You've searched me

Your holy presence  
Surrounded me  
In every season

What can separate me now

Where Your blood was she'd for me

When You said that it is done  
You tore the veil, You made a way  
When You said that it is done  
  
You tore the veil, You made a way  
When You said that it is done  
You tore the veil, You made a way

When I walk through deep waters

When I'm standing in the fire

Through the valley of the shadow  
I will not fear

Say the word and I will sing for You  
Over oceans deep, I will follow

And every breath of wind, praise  
It would still fail by far to say  
All my heart contains  
I simply live, I simply live for You  
  
Chorus:  
As the glory of Your presence  
Now fills this place  
In worship, we will meet You face to face  
There is nothing in this world  
To which You can be compared  
Glory on glory, praise upon praise  
You bind the broken hearted  
And save all my tears  
By Your word, You set the captives free  
There is nothing in this world  
That You cannot do  
I simply live, I simply live for You

How could I live without You  
How could I survive  
Without Your love  
Without Your touch

And cleanses my heart  
And sets me free  
  
Now I come right before You  
With my hands lifted up  
With my heart humbly bowed  
At Your work on the cross  
As You hang there and die  
You were paying the price  
For my life, For my life  
  
For Your love is higher than the heavens  
Deeper than the seas  
And all I want is You in my life  
No one else can satisfy my soul  
Can make me feel this way  
Only You Lord, only You

To every outcast  
A friend and comforter  
  
I come boldly to your presence  
Lord I bow before your throne  
You're my healer  
My redeemer  
You're my hope, my life, my heart

You answer the cry of the broken  
You answer the cry of the broken

Song: Singing Over Me


When I waited so long, when my tears were my song  
With my hope nearly gone You held me God  
To believe in the face of the dry, weary place  
When You felt far away You held me God  
Oh, there is freedom in surrender, oh I know it  
Your songs have never stopped  
You've been singing, always singing over me  
Your words are still enough  
And You're singing, always singing over me  
The chaos in the cause teaching me to see Lord  
The beauty in the storm so I believe  
When I see through Your eyes through the testing of time  
Every cloud silver lined 'cause You're with me  
Oh, there is freedom in surrender, oh I know it  
Your songs have never stopped  
You've been singing, always singing over me  
Your words are still enough  
And You're singing  
Give me faith  
Give me strength enough to wait  
To stand in faith  
And listen for, listen for Your melody  
Your songs have never stopped  
Your songs have never stopped  
Your songs have never stopped  
You've been singing, always singing over me  
Your words are still enough  
And You're singing, always singing over me  
Your songs have never stopped  
You've been singing, always singing over me  
Your words are still enough  
And You're singing, always singing over me  
Always singing over me, always singing over me  
Always singing over me

Verse 1  
This is my revelation  
Christ Jesus crucified  
Salvation through repentance  
At the cross on which He died  
  
Verse 2  
Now here my absolution  
Forgiveness for my sin  
And I sink beneath the waters  
That Christ was buried in

I will rise  
As Christ was raised to life  
Now in Him  
Now in Him I live

I stand a new creation  
Baptised in blood and fire  
No fear of condemnation  
By faith I'm justified  
  
Bridge  
I rise as You are risen  
Declare Your rule and reign  
My life confess Your Lordship  
And glorify Your Name  
Your word it stands eternal  
Your kingdom knows no end  
Your praise goes on forever  
And on and on again  
No pow'are can stand against You  
No curse assault Your throne  
No one can steal Your glory  
For it is Yours alone  
I stand to sing Your praises  
I stand to testify  
For I was dead in my sin  
But now I rise

Song: All Praises To The King


What a joy I feel to think about forever  
I'm a child of God  
with blessings from Heaven  
By your side, days always brighter  
The Holy one  
My Master  
My Father  
  
I will dwell in your courts  
I will sing for you

Jesus  
I love you  
  
It's a love song I sing  
It's an anthem from my heart  
All praises to the King

You're near me  
Washed me clean with hands full of mercy  
You're a resting place for all who are weary  
A perfect place  
and a new beginning

Song: Sanctuary


People, places  
Names and faces  
They come and they go, leaving traces  
Sometimes my world gets filled with so much noise  
That my heart gets pulled away  
But I find my peace in you  
  
And if I seek, I will find.  
A treasure in you that time can't take away.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Sanctuary  
Pure and holy  
In a secret place I'll find you there.  
Sanctuary  
Pure and holy  
  
In a secret place I'll find you there.  
I'll find you there  
  
(Repeat verse and chorus)  
  
Oh to be washed in the water of your holy words  
And oh to be healed by the touch of your hands  
  
In your sanctuary  
Pure and holy  
In a secret room I'll find you there.  
Sanctuary  
Pure and holy  
In the secret room I'll find you there.  
I'll find you there

Song: Love So High


Outside the city walls  
On a wooden cross  
A light in the darkness  
Bleeding from Your hands  
Flowing from Your side  
A river of mercy  
A river of mercy  
  
Your love so great  
Higher than the stars  
Unfailing love  
Deeper than the sea  
Your love so sure  
Stronger than the mountains  
Oh Your love  
It's everything to me  
How deep, how wide, how long, how high  
  
Thorns that made a crown  
Forgiveness falling down  
Your wounds are our healing  
The earth began to move  
And all of heaven knew  
Death was defeated  
And all because of You Jesus  
  
Your love so great  
Higher than the stars  
Unfailing love  
Deeper than the sea  
Your love so sure  
Stronger than the mountains  
Oh Your love  
It's everything to me  
  
Your love so great  
Higher than the stars  
Unfailing love  
Deeper than the sea  
Your love so sure  
Stronger than the mountains  
Oh Your love  
It's everything to me  
How deep, how wide, how long, how high  
How deep, how wide, how long, how high  
How deep, how wide, how long, how high  
  
Your love so high  
Your love so high  
Your love so high  
Your love so high...

Song: Faithful To The End


I'm saved from the grace that I've found in You  
All that you've done  
Through the Power of the Cross for me  
I'm saved of the mercy I've found in You  
All that you're, the fullness of Your love for me  
All that I have  
Has come from Your hand  
All I ever know is  
Jesus, You are faithful to the end  
I?ll tell of the wonders I've found in You  
And the love that You shown  
Is higher than the heaven above me  
All that I have  
Has come from Your hand  
All I ever know is  
Jesus, You are faithful to the end  
More than this world  
Could take me from Your love  
All I ever know is  
Jesus, You are faithful  
All I ever know is  
Jesus, You are faithful to the end

Song: I Will Never Be The Same Again


I will never be the same again,  
I can never return, I've closed the door.  
I will walk the path, I'll run the race  
And I will never be the same again.  
  
I will never be the same again,  
I can never return, I've closed the door.  
I will walk the path, I'll run the race  
And I will never be the same again.  
  
Fall like fire, soak like rain,  
Flow like mighty waters, again and again.  
Sweep away the darkness, burn away the chaff,  
And let the flame burn to glorify Your name.  
  
There are higher heights, there are deeper seas,  
Whatever you need to do, Lord do in me.  
The Glory of God fills my life,  
And I will never be the same again.  
  
Fall like fire, soak like rain,  
Flow like mighty waters, again and again.  
Sweep aways the darkness, burn away the chaff  
And let a flame burn to glorify Your name.  
  
Fall like fire, soak like rain,  
Flow like mighty waters, again and again.  
Sweep away the darkness, burn away the chaff,  
And let a flame burn to glorify Your name.  
  
I will never be the same again,  
I can never return, I've closed the door.  
I will walk the path, I will run the race  
And I will never be the same again.  
And I will never be the same again.  
And I will never be the same again.

Try to find the words to express the way You are  
But the beauty of the Lord

Look at the sun over the seas  
Look at Your grace that covers me

In the evening  
I can't stop praising Your Name

I can't stop praising Your Name  
In the evening, I can't stop

Yes, I want you to know, oh yes I  
And I want you to know  
Yes, I want you to know  
  
Lord You're so amazing  
Every word You say is true  
Better than the finest treasure  
So glad that I found You  
You held me close when I was down  
Your world has turned my world around  
  
Now I know, yes I know  
Now I know, I know  
How much I love you  
  
Hallelujah, we praise Your Name  
We praise Your Name

I desire Jesus  
Precious Lamb  
Who ransomed me  
Upon the cross  
He took my sin  
By His blood  
He set me free  
  
I desire Jesus  
Oh His Name  
My soul esteem  
For upon  
His thorn-scarred brow  
Is the crown of victory  
  
He is worthy of all honour  
All glory to His Name  
He alone deserves  
Our highest praise  
And forever He will reign  
  
I desire Jesus  
Triumphant One  
The earth awaits  
For on that day  
The earth will shine  
With the glory of Your Name  
  
You are worthy of all honour  
All glory to Your Name  
You alone deserve  
Our highest praise  
And forever You will reign

Song: Aftermath


The skies lay low where you are  
On the earth you rest your feet  
Yet the hands that cradle the stars  
Are the hands that bled for me  
And in that moment  
Of glorious surrender  
You were broken  
For all the world to see  
Lifted out of the ashes  
I am found in the aftermath  
Freedom found in your scars  
And in your grace my life redeemed  
For you chose  
To take the sinners crown  
As you placed your crown on me  
And in that moment  
Of glorious surrender  
Was the moment  
You broke the chains in me  
Lifted out of the ashes  
I am found in the aftermath  
And in that moment  
You opened up the heavens  
To the broken, the beggar and the thief  
Lifted out of the wreckage  
I found hope in the aftermath  
And I know  
You're with me  
Yes I know, you're with me here  
And I know, your love will light the way  
And I know, Your with me  
Yes I know, you're with me here  
And I know  
Your love will light the way  
Now all I have  
I count it all as lost  
But to know you  
To carry the cross  
Knowing I'm found  
In the light, of the aftermath

Long for You in the secret place  
All I want in this life

Guiding me on,  
Roads unkown  
I trust in You alone

My endless love  
Deeper and deeper I'm falling in love with You  
My one desire  
My only truth

Bridge  
And I will rise on wings of eagles  
Soaring high above all my fears  
I rest in Your open arms of love

Tears in the valley, My lovely I count them  
You're so precious, you were on My mind as I died  
Here I am so close to you  
Know My voice, I?ll never leave you  
For I have loved you since before  
The sands of time were made  
I love you still and always will  
You're chosen as Mine  
Cries in the desert, My child, I hear them  
Tears in the valley, My lovely, I count them  
You're so precious, you were on My mind as I died  
I love you, as I died for you, because I  
[Incomprehensible]  
I love you still, always will  
You're chosen as Mine  
I love you, I love you  
Oh, [Incomprehensible] I do  
Oh yeah, oh yeah

I Live To Know You  
  
Standing in our presence,  
Lord, my heart and life are changed.  
Just to love You and to live to  
See Your beauty and Your grace.

Nations rise up and seek Your face,  
And Your Kingdom is established,  
As I live to know You more.  
Now I will never be the same,  
Spirit of God, my life You've changed,  
And I'll forever sing- Your praise,  
I live to know You, Lord.

Your will for me I'm sure.  
Let your heart beat feel my heart's cry  
Let me live to serve your call.  
  
Heaven and earth cry out Your name,  
Nations rise up and seek Your face,  
And Your Kingdom is established,  
As I live to know You more.

We come into Your presence  
To sing a song to You  
A song of praise and honor  
For all the things You helped us through

A life in love with You  
And now I just love giving  
All my praises back to You

With love and liberty  
And I can walk with You

A life in love with You  
And now I just love giving  
All my praises back to You

Song: His Love


You're light is over me  
Flooding over me  
The night is lifted  
  
Heaven over me  
Flooding over me  
I can't contain it  
  
My cup overflows  
My cup overflows  
  
Praise the Lord  
With all my heart  
Praise Him for He  
Has done great things  
  
His banner over me is love  
His love  
His banner over me is love  
His love  
  
You brought the sunshine in  
Turned the dark to day  
You made the shadows flee away  
  
You opened up my eyes  
To a new and living way  
The dawning of a brand new day

Shouting Your praise  
You've changed my world and made my heart sing

Of glory come in  
And forever be our God

Song: I'm Singing


Only one name lasts forever  
Only one fame stands alone  
Only one King has an anthem  
That goes on and on and on  
  
And I'm singing to the God  
Who brings redemption to the nations  
Kings and oceans bow to Him in praise  
  
And I'm singing to the God  
Who wrote the book on our salvation  
To the One who covers me in grace  
I'm singing  
  
Only one word in the beginning  
Only one truth will prevail  
Only one love brings a freedom  
Only one Man took the nails  
  
And I'm singing to the God  
Who brings redemption to the nations  
Kings and oceans bow to Him in praise  
  
And I'm singing to the God  
Who wrote the book on our salvation  
To the One who covers me in grace  
I'm singing  
  
Praise, praise to the Savior  
Praise to the Lamb of God  
Praise in all of His splendor  
Praise for saving my life  
  
And I'm singing to the God  
Who brings redemption to the nations  
Kings and oceans bow to Him in praise  
  
And I'm singing to the God  
Who wrote the book on our salvation  
To the One who covers me in grace  
  
And I'm singing to the God  
Who brings redemption to the nations  
Kings and oceans bow to Him in praise  
  
And I'm singing to the God  
Who wrote the book on our salvation  
To the One who covers me in grace  
To the One who covers me in grace  
I'm singing, I'm singing, I'm singing, I'm singing

Song: Love Enough


Your loves enough to see the broken hearts  
Gain a brand new start with a brand new heart  
As the faithful hope in things unseen  
You're enough to see all the things they dream  
Come to life  
  
Were living in the Saviour today  
And this day is what we have now  
In this moment we have chosen to praise  
And it's changing how we live now  
  
Your love it broke my fall  
It's more than enough and I need it  
Cause I've never known better  
And I'll never know better  
  
Your love's enough to see the humbled man  
Find the cause of Christ  
With his outstretched hands  
As the cripple grabs his mat to walk  
You're enough to save him from the pain he bore  
  
Were living in the Saviour today  
And this day is what we have now  
In this moment we have chosen to praise  
And it's changing how we live now  
  
Your love it broke my fall  
It's more than enough and I need it  
Cause I've never known better  
And I'll never know better  
  
This love will see me soar  
It's more than enough and I need it  
Cause I've never known better  
And I'll never know better  
  
My Saviour  
You'll never let me go  
My life is now secure  
  
My Saviour  
You'll never let me go  
And in Your hands my future's brighter  
  
Your love it broke my fall  
It's more than enough and I need it  
Cause I've never known better  
And I'll never know better  
  
This love will see me soar  
It's more than enough and I need it  
Cause I've never known better  
And I'll never know better  
Cause I've never known better  
And I'll never know better

Song: Kiss Of Heaven


I'm walking a new walk  
I'll never be the same again  
Dancing a new dance in  
Your Holy Spirit Rain  
Your breath of life has overwhelmed me  
And set my spirit free  
I'm living a new life, underneath Your morning star  
Running a new race, in the shadow of Your love  
Your love is immeasurable, too deep to comprehend  
  
My Jesus, dream-maker  
My Jesus, live-giver  
I'm living under the Kiss of Heaven,  
And I'll never ever be the same again  
  
I'm singing a new song in the presence of The King  
Giving You my heart  
That is all that I can bring  
You lit a fire inside of me  
That I thought would never burn again  
I thank You, my Father, for all You've done  
And all You're going to do  
My past behind me and You before me  
I press on for more  
I'm living in the embrace of Heaven  
And I'll never ever be the same again

Song: Love Came Down


If my heart is overwhelmed  
And I cannot hear your voice  
I hold on to what is true  
Though I cannot see  
  
If the storms of life they come  
And the road ahead gets steep  
I will lift these hands in faith  
I will believe  
  
I'll remind myself  
Of all that you've done  
And the life I have  
Because of your son  
  
Love came down and rescued me  
Love came down and set me free  
I am yours  
Lord I'm forever yours  
Mountains high or valley low  
I sing out and remind my soul  
I am yours  
I am forever yours  
  
When my heart is filled with hope  
Every promise comes my way  
When I feel your hands of grace  
Rest upon me  
  
Staying desperate for you, god  
Staying humble at your feet  
I will lift these hands in praise  
I will believe  
  
I'll remind myself  
Of all that you've done  
And the life I have  
Because of your son  
  
Love came down and rescued me  
Love came down and set me free  
I am yours  
I am forever yours  
Mountains high or valley low  
I sing out and remind my soul  
I am yours  
I am forever yours  
  
I am yours  
I am yours  
All my days  
Jesus, I am yours  
  
I am yours  
I am yours  
All my days  
Jesus, I am yours  
  
Love came down and rescued me  
Love came down and set me free  
I am yours  
I am forever your's  
Mountains high or valley low  
I sing out and remind my soul  
I am yours  
I am forever yours  
  
Love came down and rescued me  
Love came down and set me free  
I am yours  
I am forever yours  
Mountains high or valley low  
I sing out and remind my soul  
I am yours  
I am forever yours

Song: Joy To The World


Joy to the world, the Lord is come  
Let earth receive her King  
Let every heart prepare Him room  
And heaven and nature sing  
And heaven and nature sing  
And heaven, and heaven, and nature sing  
  
Joy to the world, the Savior reigns  
Let men their songs employ  
While fields and floods, rocks, hills and plains  
Repeat the sounding joy  
Repeat the sounding joy  
Repeat, repeat, the sounding joy  
  
No more let sins and sorrows grow  
Nor thorns infest the ground  
He comes to make His blessings flow  
Far as the curse is found  
Far as the curse is found  
Far as, far as, the curse is found  
  
He rules the world with truth and grace  
And makes the nations prove  
The glories of His righteousness  
And wonders of His love  
And wonders of His love  
And wonders, wonders, of His love

Divinity in man confined  
This great design drawn out for me

Yet place Yourself here into mine

Our great eternal hope arrives  
This great design drawn out for me  
  
Bridge  
In our silence  
Heaven whispered out  
In our darkness  
Glory pierced the night  
  
We were broken  
But now we're lifted up  
King of heaven  
God is here with us  
  
Hallelujah  
Angels cried aloud  
Singing holy  
All the praise resound  
  
King of heaven  
On the earth be found  
King of heaven  
On the earth be found

Song: Above All


Above all powers, above all kings  
Above all nature and all created things  
Above all wisdom and all the ways of man  
You were here before the world began  
  
Above all kingdoms, above all thrones  
Above all wonders the world has ever known  
Above all wealth and treasures of the earth  
There's no way to measure what you're worth  
  
Crucified  
Laid behind a stone  
You lived to die  
Rejected and alone  
Like a rose  
Trampled on the ground  
You took the fall  
And thought of me  
Above all  
  
Above all powers, above all kings  
Above all nature and all created things  
Above all wisdom and all the ways of man  
You were here before the world began  
  
Above all kingdoms, above all thrones  
Above all wonders the world has ever known  
Above all wealth and treasures of the earth  
There's no way to measure what you're worth  
  
Crucified  
Laid behind a stone  
You lived to die  
Rejected and alone  
Like a rose  
Trampled on the ground  
You took the fall  
And thought of me  
Above all  
  
Crucified  
Laid behind a stone  
You lived to die  
Rejected and alone  
Like a rose  
Trampled on the ground  
You took the fall  
And thought of me  
Above all  
  
Like a rose  
Trampled on the ground  
You took the fall  
And thought of me  
Above all

Song: Better Than Life


Better Than Life  
Words and Music by Marty Sampson  
  
Better than the riches of this world  
Better than the sound of my friend's voices  
Better than the biggest dreams of my heart  
And that's just the start  
  
Better than getting what I say I need  
Better than living the life that I want to  
Better than the love anyone could give  
Your love is  
  
You hold me now in your arms  
And never let me go  
  
You oh Lord make the sun shine  
And the moon light in the night sky  
You give me breath and all your love  
I give my heart to you because  
  
I can't stop falling in love with you  
I'll never stop falling in love with you  
I can't stop falling in love with you  
I'll never stop falling in love with you

Song: More To See


Well, I know that I may have had my share  
Of failing and falling  
But I have come to understand  
One thing remains  
By all he's done, I have been made holy  
Worthy of serving the one  
The one who wrote eternity  
So deep in my heart  
Open your eyes and see  
The wonder of a life so wonderfully free  
Lift up your head, believe  
There is more, there's so much more to see, yeah  
You remind me still of the hope and promise  
Daring my heart to be brave  
And all the while You strengthen me  
So deep in my heart  
Open your eyes and see  
The wonder of a life so wonderfully free  
Lift up your head, believe  
There is more, there's so much more  
Lift up your head, believe  
There is more, there's so much more to see, yeah  
So much more  
His mercies are new every morning  
His mercies are new every day  
His mercies are new every morning  
Beautifully new every day  
His mercies are new every morning  
His mercies are new every day  
His mercies are new every morning  
Beautifully new every day  
His mercies are new every morning

Song: Here In My Life


have never walked on water  
Felt the waves beneath my feet  
But at Your word Lord  
I'll receive Your faith to walk on oceans deep  
  
And I remember how You found me  
In that very same place  
All my failings surely would have drowned me  
Still You made a way  
  
[Chorus]  
You are my freedom  
Jesus You're the reason  
I'm knelling again at your throne  
Where would I be without You  
Here in my life  
Here in my life  
  
You have said that all the heavens  
Sing for joy at one who finds the  
Way to freedom truth of Jesus  
Brought from death into this life  
  
And I remember how You saw me  
Through the eyes of Your grace  
And though the price was Your beloved for me  
Still You made a way  
  
[Chorus: x 2]  
  
(Chorus being sung in the background repeatedly)

Song: Only Your Love


Your love is strong and mighty  
Its jealousy unyielding  
It burns for me like a fire untamed  
Your love is all consuming  
You never stop pursuing  
Nothing I could face could take it away  
  
Oh, oh, oh Your love  
Oh, oh oh  
  
Your love is like no other  
Nothing else satisfies  
It flows through the deepest parts  
It rests on the mountain high  
Your love is overwhelming  
Brought me to life again  
Your love, it lasts forever  
In You there'll be no end  
  
Oh, oh, only Your love  
Oh, oh, only Your love  
Oh, oh, only Your love  
  
Nothing can separate us  
Many trials can't hide Your love  
No sorrow can wash it away  
  
Oh, oh, oh Your love  
Oh, oh, oh  
  
Your love is like no other  
Nothing else satisfies  
It flows through the deepest parts  
It rests on the mountains high  
Your love is overwhelming  
Brought me to life again  
Your love, it lasts forever  
In You there'll be no end  
  
Oh, oh, only Your love  
Oh, oh, only Your love  
Oh, oh, only Your love  
  
How deep  
How wide  
How long  
How high (repeat)  
  
Your love is like no other  
Nothing else satisfies  
It flows through the deepest parts  
It rests on the mountains high  
Your love is overwhelming  
Brought me to life again  
Your love, it lasts forever  
In You there'll be no end (repeat)  
  
Oh, oh, only Your love  
Oh, oh, only Your love  
Oh, oh, only Your love

Song: Magnificent


Who compares to You?  
Who set the stars in their place?  
You who calmed the raging seas  
That came crashing over me  
  
Who compares to You?  
You who bring the morning light  
The hope of all the earth  
Is rest assured in Your great love  
  
You are magnificent  
Eternally wonderful, glorious  
Jesus, no one ever will compare  
To You, Jesus  
  
Where the evening fades  
You call forth songs of joy  
As the morning wakes  
We, Your children give You praise  
  
You are magnificent  
Eternally wonderful, glorious  
Jesus, no one ever will compare

Waiting for a sign

Song: Heartbeats


Love strung out I am found in the price You paid  
I know that Your life is the blood running through my veins  
My eyes fixed wide on the light of the cross again  
I feel the weight drop in the wake of the empty grave  
  
I want You, need You  
I love You Jesus  
My heart beats forever  
Just to know You  
Let go and throw  
My future into Your hands  
Again  
  
Heart beats loud to the sound of a different drum  
Calling me out from the crowd to pursue the One  
  
I want You, need You  
I love You Jesus  
My heart beats forever  
Just to know You  
Let go and throw  
My future into Your hands  
  
I want You, need You  
I love You Jesus  
My heart beats forever  
Just to know You  
Let go and throw  
My future into Your hands  
Again  
  
Break me down till I soar on grace  
Lead me on through the fire and rain  
The rhythm of my heart beats wild  
For Your endless praise  
Every waking hour I will seek Your face  
  
I want You, need You  
I love You Jesus  
My heart beats forever  
Just to know You  
Let go and throw  
My future into Your hands  
  
I want You, need You  
I love You Jesus  
My heart beats forever  
Just to know You  
Let go and throw  
My future into Your hands

Song: Empires


We are worlds we are bodies  
Empires of dirt and grace  
Silhouettes and reflections  
Caught in his holy flame  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Beneath our skin  
A new creation  
The night is done  
Our chains are broken  
Our time has come  
The wait is over  
The King is here  
And his name is Jesus  
  
[Chorus]  
This is love and it's God's to heal the broken  
This is love bleeding life into the grave  
Hear the sound as our hearts cry out forever  
Singing hallelujah  
Breathing in a brand new [world?], oh  
  
We are shadows and portraits  
Empires of life and clay  
Images of our maker  
Sinners called out as saints  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
[Chorus]x2  
  
[Bridge]  
No eye has seen  
No ear has heard  
No mind conceived  
What heaven holds  
But here and now  
Let earth be found  
With all our crowns upon your name  
  
[Long instrumental break]

And lay my life before You,  
I come to worship You alone, oh my God.

With the power of Your presence,  
And your beauty all around me,  
As the heavens stand in awe of You  
Let me hear Your voice.

The light of the world  
Shining in love  
Taking the fall upon Your shoulders  
You shattered the dark

And leaving the rescued for the fallen  
You're leading us home

Reaching out Your hand

The battle is won  
Jesus in love You reign

Just let me say how much I love You  
Let me speak of Your mercy and grace

And the earth will shake as Your Word goes forth  
And the heavens will tremble and fall  
But let me say how much I love You  
Oh my Savior, my Lord and Friend  
  
Just let me hear Your finest whispers  
As You gently call my name  
And let me see Your power and Your glory  
Let me feel Your spirit's flame  
  
Let me find You in the desert  
Till this sand is holy ground  
And I am found completely surrendered  
To You my Lord and Friend  
  
So let me say how much I love You  
With all my heart I long for You  
For I am caught in this passion of knowing  
This endless love I've found in You  
  
And the depth of grace, the forgiveness found  
To be called a child of God  
Just makes me say how much I love You  
Oh my Savior, my Lord and Friend (x2)  
  
Just makes me say how much I love You  
Oh my Savior, my Lord and Friend

Now I stand here in  
In Your grace again  
  
As I look into the sky above  
Wonder how my life has changed  
Wonder how Your love, it came to me  
As I look into the sky above  
All my fears, so far away  
All I hear is heaven calling me  
  
So I look to You  
So I look to You  
No one else will do  
No one else will do

I desire Jesus  
Precious Lamb Who ransomed me  
Upon the cross He took my sin  
By His blood He set me free  
  
I desire Jesus  
Oh His Name My soul esteem  
For upon His thorn-scarred brow  
Is the crown of victory

He is worthy of all honour  
All glory to His Name  
He alone deserves Our highest praise  
And forever He will reign  
  
I desire Jesus  
Triumphant One The earth awaits  
For on that day The earth will shine  
With the glory of Your Name  
  
Chorus 2  
You are worthy of all honour  
All glory to Your Name  
You alone deserve Our highest praise  
And forever You will reign

My heart leans in  
My soul must sing  
You are all glorious

Bridge x2  
  
I desire Jesus  
Precious Lamb Who ransomed me  
Unto You an offering  
Will my life forever be

Song: I Feel Like I'm Falling


Standing tall in this wide space  
Getting lost in Your embrace  
I see a fire burning brighter  
It's calling me to catch the flame  
  
I feel like I'm falling over and over in love with You  
It's not just a feeling, but I know that He is real  
I feel like I'm falling into the arms of a mighty God  
It's not just a feeling, but I know that He is real  
  
You're drawing me closer to Your side  
It's the safest place I know where to hide  
With one glance You captured my heart  
You speak Your words and set me apart  
  
I feel like I'm falling, I feel like I'm falling  
I feel like I'm falling, falling into the arms of love

Saved by your mercy  
Found in your grace  
Totally surrendered to your embrace  
And there's nothing more than you  
  
See your perfection  
I'm lost in your peace  
Your faithfulness sings over me  
And your love is the light of my soul  
  
And I lift my eyes to you  
Creator of the world  
  
And I stand in awe of you  
Of your glory  
And I live to worship you  
Son of god, king of heaven  
  
And the angels round your throne  
Cry out holy  
To the one who is to come  
Hear us sing hallelujah  
  
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah

You hold it all at once  
The earth and all within  
You look with eyes of love  
To the sons of man  
That I am known by You  
Compels my heart to sing

There's laughter and there's pain  
Your kindness leads me on  
To the light again  
So I live and breathe  
And find myself in You

I count it all but loss  
Compared to knowing You  
I give my life away  
To know You any day

He is here for the broken and life to the one who is undone  
He is peace to the wounded and hope for the helpless one  
He is here, He is here  
Be still my soul, be still

We call out Your Name in the darkness  
And watch as Your glory unfolds

Almighty God, my Redeemer,  
My Hiding Place, my Safe Refugee,  
No other name like Jesus,  
No power can stand against You.

And I will not be shaken,  
My hope it comes from You alone,

Your Word is living in my heart,  
And I will praise You with a new song,  
My soul will bless You Lord.  
You fill my life with greater joy,  
Yes, I delight myself in You,  
And I will praise You with a new song,  
My soul will bless You Lord.  
  
When I am weak You make me strong,  
When I'm poor, I know I'm rich,  
For in the power of Your name.  
All things are possible,

He can move the mountains  
My God is Mighty to save  
He is Mighty to save  
Forever  
Author of salvation  
He rose and conquered the grave  
Jesus conquered the grave  
  
So take me as You find me  
All my fears and failures  
Fill my life again  
I give my life to follow  
Everything I believe in  
Now I surrender  
  
Shine your light and let the whole world see  
We're singing for the glory of the risen King...Jesus

Song: Shine For You


Look across the world  
And let us shine for you, Lord  
The whole world is yours  
And I want to live for you  
  
One thing I know  
Is that you've changed my life  
I give you my all  
All you are is good  
Give you my heart  
God it's only you I seek  
Give you my praise  
'Cause I believe in you  
  
Look across the world  
And let us shine for you, Lord  
The whole world is yours  
And I want to live for you, O God  
  
All that I know  
Is that you've changed my life  
I give you my all  
And all you are is good  
Carry the lost  
Make my prayer in this life real  
Carry my cross  
Hold on 'til I see you  
  
Look across the world  
And let us shine for you, Lord  
The whole world is yours  
And I want to live for you, O God  
  
And I want to live  
I want to love you more  
I want to be used  
Father in all of the world  
May your word be heard  
May it stay on my lips  
Live what I speak  
Until your kingdom come  
Look across the world  
And let us shine for you  
And let us shine for you  
Look across the world  
And let us shine for you, Lord  
The whole world is yours  
And I want to live for you  
Look across the world  
And let us shine for you, Lord  
The whole world is yours  
And I want to live for you  
And I want to live for you  
And I want to live for you

Song: Closer Than You Know


I tempered the storm  
Though your faith was small  
I prayed while you slept  
And the night waged war  
We stood at the fire  
And we walked on sea  
And we drank of the wine  
That was made of me  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't turn your eyes from me  
For my love won't be undone  
Don't hide your face from me  
For my light has surely come  
Surely come, surely come  
  
I carried that cross  
And I felt your pain  
I took up your crown  
And I wore your shame  
And death was a fire  
And its teeth were grim  
But I left it behind  
Along with all your sins  
  
[Chorus 2]  
Don't turn away from me  
For my love won't be undone  
Don't hide your face from me  
For my light has surely come  
Surely come, surely come  
  
Lift up your eyes and see  
Heaven is closer than you know  
Lift up your voice and sing  
Know that My love won't let you go  
And I won't forsake you  
Lift up your eyes and see  
Heaven is closer than you know  
Know I'll never leave you  
  
So lift up your voice and sing  
Know that My love won't let you go  
And My light has surely come  
Surely come, surely come  
  
And I'm closer than you know  
And I'm closer than you know  
  
[Bridge]  
Lord I hear you I know You're there  
Closer now than my skin and bones could bare  
Breathing deep within me  
You are always with me  
I can see you where eyes can't stare  
Brighter now than the sun could ever dare  
Breathing all around me  
God I know you're with me here  
(God I know that you are here)  
  
For I am yours and you are mine  
And my soul knows well  
You are here  
You are here  
And my soul will praise you  
And my soul will praise Your name  
Singing Holy is your name  
Jesus  
Jesus

Song: I'm Still Standing


You gave me courage to believe  
That all Your Goodness I could see  
Cause if it had not been for You  
Standing on my side  
Where would I be  
  
Chorus:  
If not for Your Goodness  
If not for Your Grace  
I don't know where I would be today  
If not for Your Kindness  
I never could say, I'm still standing  
If not for Your Mercy  
If not for Your Love  
I most likely would have given up  
If not for Your Favor  
I never could say, I'm still standing  
But by the Grace of God  
  
To You I lift my offering  
And set my heart on higher things  
Cause if it had not been for You  
Standing on my side  
Where would I be  
  
On Christ, The Solid Rock I'll Stand  
All other ground is sinking sand  
On Christ, The Solid Rock I'll Stand  
But by the Grace of God  
  
I'm still standing, I'm still standing  
I'm still standing  
But by the Grace  
But by the Grace of God

Song: In Freedom


In freedom  
Words and Music by: Aran Puddle  
  
A rising generation  
Set apart for liberty  
A royal loving people  
Chosen to be mighty  
Mighty in the land  
  
A people who are hungry  
Hungry for the bread of life  
A people who are thirsty  
Thirsty for the river  
The river of joy  
  
All across the nation  
A cry is ringing out  
The church of the king's breaking out  
  
In freedom  
In power  
In healing  
Salvation to the end of the earth

Song: Hosanna


I see the King of glory  
Coming on the clouds with fire  
The whole earth shakes

I see His love and mercy  
Washing over all our sin  
The people sing  
The people sing  
  
[Chorus: 2]  
Hosanna  
Hosanna  
Hosanna in the Highest  
  
I see a generation  
Rising up to take their place  
With selfless faith  
With selfless faith  
  
I see a near revival  
Stirring as we pray and seek  
We're on our knees  
We're on our knees  
  
[Chorus: x 2]  
  
Heal my heart and make it clean  
Open up my eyes to the things unseen  
Show me how to love like You  
Have loved me  
  
Break my heart for what breaks Yours  
Everything I am for Your Kingdom's cause  
As I walk from earth into eternity  
  
[Chorus: x 4]  
  
Hosanna in the highest [Repeat: x 3]

Hope has found its home within me  
Now that I've been found in You  
Let all that I am be all You want me to be  
'Cause all I want is more of You  
  
Let Your presence fall upon us  
I want to see You face to face  
Let me live forever lost in Your love  
'Cause all I want is more of You  
All I want is more of You  
  
I'm living for this cause  
I lay down my life  
Into Your hands

The hope of the world  
In You I'll stand  
'Cause all I want is You  
All I want is  
All I want is You

In Your name  
There is hope when all seems lost  
There is freedom in the power of the cross  
Let the world see  
  
In Your name  
There is truth where logic fails  
Understanding that makes sense of our days  
You are worthy  
  
Hear the sound of all creation roar  
We're crying out as one  
To You our God  
Now show us the way of Your love  
And we will come running

All for Jesus name  
Your love displayed  
We are alive in the mystery  
All for sinners' gain  
Your life You gave  
We'll sing Your praise for eternity  
  
In Your name  
There is mercy without end  
Overtaking us now time and again  
Let the world see  
In Your name  
There is love that never fails  
And the promist that Your love will prevail  
You are worthy  
  
Hear the sound of all creation roar  
We're crying out as one  
To You our God  
Now show us the way of Your love  
And we will come running  
  
[Chorus: x 2]  
  
Hallelujah  
Hallelujah

We come into Your presence  
To sing a song to You  
A song of praise and honour  
For all the things you helped us through  
  
You gave a life worth living  
A life in love in with You  
And now I just love giving  
All my praises back to You

From the empty tomb that day  
And You set your people free  
With love and liberty  
And I can walk with you  
Every night and every day

Song: Steady My Heart


Wish it could be easy  
Why is life so messy  
Why is pain a part of us  
There are days I feel like  
Nothing ever goes right  
Sometimes it just hurts so much  
  
But You're here  
You're real  
I know I can trust You  
  
Even when it hurts  
Even when it's hard  
Even when it all just falls apart  
I will run to You  
Cause I know that You are  
  
Lover of my soul  
Healer of my scars  
You steady my heart  
You steady my heart  
  
I'm not gonna worry  
I know that You got me  
Right inside the palm of your hand  
Each and every moment  
What's good and what gets broken  
Happens just the way that You plan  
  
And I will run to You  
You're my refuge in Your arms  
And I will sing to You  
Cause of everything You are  
  
You steady my heart  
You steady my heart

Lamp unto my feet  
Light unto my path

With all my heart  
With all my soul

And praise forevermore  
Praise forevermore

On wings of Heaven I will soar  
With You  
  
You take my brokenness  
And call me to yourself  
There You stand,  
Healing in Your hand

Where Your blood was spilled  
For my ransom  
Everything I once held dear

Ready at the line looking out  
Looking out to all that's ahead  
When every heart  
Confesses Your Name  
We're pressing on towards that Day  
We're never gonna stop  
We're never gonna stop  
  
Letting go of every mistake  
Throwing off the chains of restraint  
All that will remain  
A passion for Your Name  
Burning as we run this race  
We're never gonna stop  
We're never gonna stop  
We're never gonna stop  
We're never gonna stop  
  
We are running  
Chasing after all that You are  
We are running  
'Cause all that You are  
Is all that we want now  
  
Every stride is taken in faith  
Every step compelled by Your grace  
We're taking up our cross  
No matter what the cost  
We give it all to go Your way  
We're never gonna stop  
We're never gonna stop  
  
Onwards we draw towards Your light  
Desperate we seek to know You more and more  
Further we look beyond ourselves  
To Your love  
To your love

Song: Hosanna


I see the King of glory  
Coming on the clouds of fire  
The whole earth shakes, the whole earth shakes  
I see His love and mercy  
Washing over all our sin  
The people sing, the people sing

With selfless faith, with selfless faith  
I see a near revival  
Staring as we pray and seek  
We're on our knees, we're on our knees

Heal my heart and make it clean  
Open up my eyes to the things unseen  
Show me how to love like You have loved me  
Break my heart for what breaks Yours  
Everything I am for Your kingdom's cause  
As I walk from earth into eternity

You crossed the great divide, you took out place  
You offered up your life though we had failed  
The veil was torn and love remained  
You are holy Lord

We offer up our lives to bring you praise  
A love that walls cannot contain  
You are holy Lord

A living sacrifice, we worship you  
A people undivided, Lord, hear us sing  
We are yours, and you are our King

Lord, break down these walls, and see how we love  
Desperate for all you are, we chase your heart

We didn't come to leave here entertained  
Worship under any other name  
We're crying out for you alone  
You are holy Lord

We find our voice, we found our voice  
We're on our knees, the carpets worn  
As we join our hearts with distant shores  
And sing to you, Lord

Come all ye weary and ye broken  
Come to the table of the Lord  
Come sing the song of the forgiven  
Come lay your burden on the word  
Come and find peace  
Everyone needs a little rest  
Everyone needs a little joy

Call upon the mercy of the Lord  
Come sing the song of redemption  
Sing about the hope that is to come  
Come and find peace

He will lift you up higher than sorrow  
He will lift you up  
And cover your soul with healing

Song: Fire Fall Down


'Cause I know that You're alive  
You came to fix my broken life  
And I'll sing to glorify  
Your Holy Name, Jesus Christ  
  
You bought my life with the  
Blood that You shed on the cross  
When You died for the sins of men  
And You let out a cry, crucified, now alive in me  
  
These hands are Yours  
Teach them to serve as You please  
And I'll reach out desperate to see  
All the greatness of God  
May my soul rest assured in You  
  
I'll never be the same  
No, I'll never be the same  
  
'Cause I know that You're alive  
You came to fix my broken life  
And I'll sing to glorify  
Your Holy Name, Jesus Christ

When I spoke and confessed  
In You I'm blessed, now, I walk in the light  
In victorious sight of You  
  
I'll never be the same  
No, I'll never be the same  
  
'Cause I know that You're alive  
You came to fix my broken life  
And I'll sing to glorify  
Your Holy Name, Jesus Christ

You came to fix my broken life  
And I'll sing to glorify  
Your Holy Name, Jesus Christ

Where I was going

Waiting for a sign

Gave me direction  
Strong on the inside

Now I've made up my mind  
To be all You want for me  
All I do  
Is live my life for You  
I know it's true  
I'll never let You go  
All I do  
I'd anything for You  
Everything is in Your Hands  
So I get up  
Get up and praise You  
And I know where I'm going  
I know where I'm going

Song: I Believe


I said on Sunday how much I want revival  
But then on Monday I can't even find my bible  
Where's power, the power of the cross in my life?  
I'm sick of playing the game of religion  
  
I'm tired of loosing my reason for living  
Where's power, the power of the cross in my life?  
I'm not content just to walk through my life  
Giving in to the lies walking in compromises  
  
Now we cried out as a generation that was lost  
But now is found in the power of the cross  
We believe in You, we believe in the power of the cross and it?s true  
We believe in You, so we lay down the cause that the cross might be found in
You  
  
I'm not satisfied living in my own ways  
I'm not satisfied to do church and walk away  
I'm not satisfied there's no love in my life but You  
I'm not satisfied living in yesterday?s hour  
I'm not satisfied to have the form but not power  
I'm not satisfied oh Lord I am crucified in You

Will flow Your mercy and Your grace  
Proclaiming love and liberty for all who have an ear to hear  
  
And Your love stirs faith and hope in me  
And Your grace brings power to set this sinner free  
And Your blood pours joy into my life  
Jesus, You gave it all for me

His hands once bound now save  
Our God will never fail  
  
He is Lord  
He is Lord  
Sings my soul  
He is the Lord  
And He lives  
Yes He lives  
I?m alive  
Cause Jesus lives  
  
'Tis at the cross of Christ  
Where earth and heaven meet  
Where sin is overcome  
To God the victory  
  
And now  
Let the earth resound with praise  
For our Saviour God He reigns  
He is high and lifted up  
Arise  
For the King of glory waits  
He is coming back again  
He is coming back again

Song: Oceans Will Part


If my heart has grown cold  
There Your love will unfold  
As You open my eyes to the work of Your hand  
When I'm blind to my way  
There Your Spirit will pray  
As You open my eyes to the work of Your hand  
As You open my eyes to the work of Your hand  
  
Oceans will part nations come  
At the whisper of Your call  
Hope will rise glory shine  
In my life Your will be done  
  
Present suffering may pass  
Lord Your mercy will last  
As You open my eyes to the work of Your hand  
And my heart will find praise  
I?ll delight in Your way  
As You open my eyes to the work of Your hand  
As You open my eyes to the work of Your hand

Song: Home


Into Your courts I run with praises  
Flowing from my heart  
Every day I wake I sing Your song  
It's the anthem of my life  
  
I want to spend my days  
In Your presence, Lord  
Bowed before Your throne  
In the house of God  
Is where I find my peace  
It's where I find my  
  
Home is heaven  
One day Lord, I will live  
In Your courts, You'll find me  
In worship at Your feet  
Hide me now  
In the shadow of Your wings  
Where I will be  
Where I will be  
  
Your love is all I need  
So desperately I have sought Your face  
I know You hear my every cry  
And petition that I make  
  
Jesus, oh You are my treasure  
Jesus, oh You are my treasure

I will bless the Lord forever  
And I will trust Him at all times

And He has set my feet upon a rock

Song: Always


Did You raise the sun for me?  
Or paint a million stars that I might  
Know Your majesty?  
Is Your voice upon the wind?  
Is everything I've known marked  
With my maker's fingerprints?  
  
Breathe on me  
Let me see Your face  
Ever will I seek You  
  
Chorus:  
'Cause all You are, is all I want, always  
Draw me close in Your arms  
Oh God, I wanna be with You  
  
Can I feel You in the rain?  
Abandon all I am to have You  
Capture me again  
Let the earth resound with praise  
Can You hear as all creation lives  
To glorify one name?  
  
'Cause all You are, is all I want, always  
Draw me close in Your arms  
Oh God, I wanna be with You

Song: Grace Abounds


You lay aside Your throne  
And to this world  
You have come  
  
You offered up Your life  
The debt You paid  
Was not Yours  
  
Your grace abounds to me  
Your grace abounds to me  
Jesus  
In You I find all that I need  
  
A gift I could not earn  
Your open arms  
Are undeserved  
  
Enabled by Your grace  
Now to live  
Is Christ alone  
  
All powerful  
All glorious  
There's nothing like the Name of Jesus  
  
All powerful  
All glorious  
There's nothing like Your Name

Take these tainted hands  
Wash me in Your love

Lord I come  
Lord I thank you  
For your love  
For this grace divine  
Love and mercy  
Undeserving  
You gave it all  
The greatest sacrifice  
  
You were wounded

And You were bruised  
For all my shame  
You were broken  
For my healing  
Only by the cross

To every outcast  
A friend and comforter  
  
I come boldly to your presence  
Lord I bow before your throne  
You're my healer  
My redeemer  
You're my hope, my life, my all

God is good all the time

I was looking for peace in my mind  
God is good  
Then Jesus showed me a better way  
That's the reason I testify that  
God is good, so good

Song: All I Need Is You


Left my fear by side of the road  
Hear You speak, won't let go  
Fall to my knees as I lift my hands to pray  
Got every reason to be here again  
Father's love, that draws me in  
And all my eyes wanna see is a glimpse of You  
  
All I need is You  
All I need is You Lord, is You Lord  
  
All I need is You  
All I need is You lord, is You Lord  
  
One more day and it's not the same  
Your spirit calls my heart to sing  
Drawn to the voice of my Savior once again  
Where would my soul be without Your Son  
Gave His life to save the earth  
Rest in the thought that You're watching over me  
  
All I need is You  
All I need is You Lord, is You Lord  
  
All I need is You  
All I need is You Lord, is You Lord  
  
You hold the universe  
You hold everyone on earth  
You hold the universe  
You hold, You hold  
  
'Cos all I need, is You  
All I need is You  
  
All I need is You  
All I need is You Lord, is You Lord

Song: King Of All Days


In your surrender  
As you laid down your life  
You took up a sinner's cross  
And your life rescued mine  
  
In this redemption  
Love and mercy displayed  
You lifted my eyes to see  
That your truth never fails  
  
[Bridge:]  
Lord of the heavens  
King of all days  
Without you my world slips away  
Redeemed by your mercy  
Consumed by your grace  
Now I live for you  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm found in the arms of love  
For your love it has saved my soul  
I'll run to your arms of love  
Your light's gonna lead me home  
  
Glorious savior  
In your light I am free  
The things of this world will fade  
Still you are all that I need  
  
At your cross I lay my burdens  
At your feet, where your love covers  
All I've done  
Now I walk with you lord

A rugged cross  
A humble King  
How beautiful the mystery

Your name will reign through all eternity  
Our hope, our strength, our victory  
We bow down, down at Your feet

Would you believe me if I said  
That you don't need to wait for the answer before  
You step out in faith  
Would you believe me if I said  
That nothin' is ever impossible for God  
  
Just live you life with God inside  
You won our regret one moment of it  
And give all that you can for God. for God

Words and Music by Tulele Faletolu and Marty Sampson  
  
Try to find the words  
To express the way you are  
But the beauty of the lord  
Cannot be described in just one lifetime  
  
Look at the sun over the seas  
Look at your grace that covers me

Every word you say is true  
Better than the finest treausre  
So glad that I found you

Song: From The Inside Out


A thousand times I've failed  
Still Your mercy remains  
And should I stumble again  
I'm caught in Your grace  
  
Everlasting  
Your light will shine when all else fades  
Never ending  
Your glory goes beyond all fame  
  
Your will above all else  
My purpose remains  
The art of losing myself  
In bringing You praise  
  
In my heart and my soul  
Lord I give You control  
Consume me from the inside out  
Lord let justice and praise  
Become my embrace  
To love you from the inside out  
  
Everlasting  
Your light will shine when all else fades  
Never ending  
Your glory goes beyond all fame  
And the cry of my heart  
Is to bring You praise  
From the inside out  
Lord my soul cries out

O Holy Night  
Oh holy night! The stars are brightly shining  
It is the night of our dear Saviour's birth  
Long lay the world in sin and error pining  
Till He appeared and the soul felt it's worth  
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices  
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.  
  
Fall on your knees! Oh, hear the angels voices  
Oh night divine, Oh night when Christ was born  
Oh night divine, Oh night, Oh night divine.  
  
Truly He taught us to love one another  
His law is love and His gospel is peace  
Chains shall He break for the slave is our brother  
And in His name all oppression shall cease  
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we  
Let all within us praise His holy name  
  
Christ is the Lord! O praise His Name forever  
His power and glory evermore proclaim  
  
Fall on your knees! Oh, hear the angel voices  
Oh night divine, Oh night when Christ was born  
Oh night divine, Oh night, Oh night Divine

Song: Am I To Believe?


Am I to believe  
That a God would give His Son?  
Am I to believe  
That the world was bought with love?  
Am I to believe  
That a stranger died for me?  
Am I to believe  
That a Saviour set me free?  
Cause I have felt the cold rain  
Run down my face  
I've seen the sun rise up  
As the night turns to day  
I've heard the laughter  
As the children play  
But above all  
I just live to say that  
Chorus:  
Yeah, oh yeah  
I believe in the God of love  
Yeah, oh yeah  
I believe in the risen son  
Am I to believe  
That the sick shall overcome?  
Am I to believe  
That my freedom has been won?  
I believe in You

I'll follow Your voice straight into the dark  
And if from the course You intend I depart  
Speak to the sails of my wandering heart

Like the wind You'll guide  
Clear the skies before me  
And I'll glide this open sea  
Like the stars, Your Word  
Will align my voyage  
And remind me where I've been  
And where I am going  
  
Lost in the shallows amidst fear and fog  
Your truth is the compass  
That points me back north  
Jesus, my Captain  
My soul's trusted Lord  
All my allegiance is rightfully Yours  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Jesus, my Captain  
My soul's trusted Lord  
All my allegiance is rightfully Yours

Song: Jesus, Jesus


Jesus, Jesus, one touch of Your hand  
I am healed and I am whole  
Jesus, Jesus, one glimpse of Your face  
Brings fire to my soul  
  
And Jesus, I come, beholding Your face  
I am changed from glory to glory  
And now I see and now I know  
One touch of Your life  
Brings glory to my soul  
  
Jesus, Jesus, from darkness to light  
My life overflows  
Jesus, Jesus, Your mercy and grace  
Like a river flowing down  
  
And Jesus, I come, beholding Your face  
I am changed from glory to glory  
And now I see and now I know  
One touch of Your life  
Brings glory to my soul  
  
And Jesus, I come, beholding Your face  
I am changed from glory to glory  
And now I see and now I know  
One touch of Your life  
Brings glory to my soul  
  
And now I see and now I know  
One touch of Your life  
Brings glory to my soul  
And now I see and now I know  
One touch of Your life  
Brings glory to my soul  
  
Jesus, Jesus  
Jesus, Jesus  
Jesus, Jesus  
Jesus, Jesus
